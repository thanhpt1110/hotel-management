1. First, launch Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio:

    - Step 1: Obtain the Server name when you start this application.

    - Step 2: Run the SQLHotelManagement.sql file, and you can create the Database name as you like. The default is "HotelManagement".

    **Note: Use Windows Authentication for authentication.**

2. Now, open the HotelManagement.sln file using Visual Studio.

3. Installation is complete, and you can press "Run" to start the program (the shortcut key in Visual Studio is F5). At this point, the application will ask for the "Server name" (Step 1) and "Database name" (Step 2) that you set up earlier.

> For convenience, the team has created a default database. You can use it immediately. The default account is admin, and the password is 1234.
(Note: If you use the default database, the data will not be saved when you close the program).
